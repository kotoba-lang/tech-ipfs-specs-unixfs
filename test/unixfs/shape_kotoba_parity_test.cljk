;; `kotoba/unixfs/shape.kotoba` against `unixfs.file/build`.
;;
;; The slice is the SHAPE of the balanced DAG, which is decided entirely by
;; the file's length. So the parity is unusual and worth stating plainly:
;; the oracle is given the bytes and builds the tree; the guest is given
;; only how many bytes there were, and must describe the same tree.
;;
;; If they agree, the shape really was a function of the length, and the
;; guest really does not need the file.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph).
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; `unixfs.file`'s own docstring names each of these as a way to build a
;; valid-looking DAG that nothing else agrees with:
;;
;;   * `an-empty-file-is-one-empty-chunk` — "a file with no leaves would
;;     have no CID at all". Zero is not a smaller answer, it is no answer;
;;   * `a-one-chunk-file-is-the-raw-block` — no wrapper, no dag-pb node.
;;     The reference implementation special-cases it, so a wrapper produces
;;     a DAG no `ipfs get` will agree with;
;;   * `the-hundred-and-seventy-fifth-chunk-gets-its-own-node` — at 175 the
;;     root has two children and the second covers ONE chunk, still wrapped.
;;     "A bare raw leaf as the second child would be a smaller, reasonable,
;;     different DAG";
;;   * `logical-size-is-not-encoded-size` — `blocksizes` is the file's
;;     bytes; `Tsize` is the encoded subtree. Both live in every node and
;;     confusing them produces a DAG that verifies against itself and
;;     against nothing else.
