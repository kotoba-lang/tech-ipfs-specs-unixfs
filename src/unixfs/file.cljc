  "UnixFS files — the balanced DAG `ipfs add` builds, in portable `.cljc`.

  `multiformats.core/cidv1-raw` has always addressed a single block
  correctly, and said so: *byte-identical to `ipfs add --cid-version=1
  --raw-leaves` for single-block (≤256 KiB) inputs*. `cid-of-file` threw
  above that with `a multi-block dag-pb CID is out of scope`. This is that
  scope — the chunker, the tree, and the UnixFS file header that make a
  256 KiB limit into no limit.

  ## The shape, which is not the obvious one

  Bytes are split into 256 KiB chunks stored as **raw** blocks. A file of
  one chunk is that raw block: no wrapper, no dag-pb node, and the CID
  starts `bafkrei…`. Only from the second chunk does a dag-pb root appear.
  Getting this wrong produces a valid-looking DAG that no `ipfs get` will
  ever agree with, because the reference implementation special-cases it.

  Above the leaves, nodes take up to 174 children — `DefaultLinksPerBlock`,
  which go-unixfs derives from an 8 KiB target block and a ~47-byte link,
  and which is therefore a constant of the format rather than a tuning
  knob. Levels are filled left to right: 175 chunks is a root of two
  children, the first covering a full 174 and the second covering one. The
  single remaining chunk is still wrapped in its own dag-pb node — a bare
  raw leaf as the second child would be a smaller, reasonable, different
  DAG.

  ## Tsize is the subtree, not the block

  A link's `Tsize` is the total encoded size of everything under it: a raw
  leaf's own length, or a dag-pb node's block length plus the `Tsize` of
  each of its children. `blocksizes` in the file header is the other
  measure — the *logical* bytes each child contributes to the file. Both
  are in every node and they are not the same number.

  ## What this is checked against

  Real CIDs from kubo 0.41, pinned in `unixfs.file-test`, across the
  boundaries that matter: empty, one byte, exactly one chunk, one chunk
  plus one byte, a full 174-link node, 175, and a file deep enough to need
  three levels above the leaves."
